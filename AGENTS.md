# Project Operating Rules

Read this file before acting in this repository. These instructions apply to the
`cross-agent` project (Trinity multi-agent orchestrator).

## Prime Directive

The single goal of this project is correct, trustworthy orchestration of coding
agents: every run must produce reviewed, working changes in a target project
without ever corrupting that project or silently lowering quality.

Before running any request, ask whether it preserves orchestration correctness,
output quality, and the safety of any target project the tool operates on. If a
request trades those away for speed, cost, convenience, or throughput, stop and
warn the user before acting.

Priority order when goals conflict:

1. Correctness and safety — never damage a target project; guardrails (branch
   isolation, dirty-worktree refusal, explicit stop reasons) always hold.
2. Output quality — reviewer verdicts are real, not rubber-stamped; the loop only
   declares success on genuine approval.
3. Orchestration reliability and UX clarity — stable runs, live visibility, never
   a silent stop.
4. Code quality, maintainability, readability, and testability.
5. Technology choices optimized for Apple Silicon M2, when compatible with the
   higher priorities.

If a change improves a lower priority but harms a higher one, stop, warn, and
wait for confirmation. Do not trade quality for throughput unsilently.

## Reasoning Tier Handshake

The Codex UI Reasoning setting is assumed to be Medium by default.

For every user task, start the response with:

`Reasoning tier: Low/Medium/High/Max -- reason.`

Then follow this control flow:

- If the task only needs Low or Medium reasoning, proceed immediately in the
  same turn.
- If the task needs High or Max reasoning, stop after the recommendation and ask
  the user to flip the Codex UI Reasoning setting to that tier.
- Do not execute High/Max work until the user confirms they changed the UI.
- The purpose is to keep light tasks one-turn and cheap, while heavy tasks cost
  exactly one UI flip plus one execution turn.

## OpenWolf

This project uses OpenWolf for context management.

- Read and follow `.wolf/OPENWOLF.md` every session.
- Check `.wolf/anatomy.md` before reading project files.
- Check `.wolf/cerebrum.md` before generating code.

## Cross-Agent Entry Points

All coding agents working in this project must obey the same project contract:

- Codex: read this root `AGENTS.md`.
- Claude: read root `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/rules/*`.
- Antigravity: read `.agent/AGENTS.md` plus project-local `.agent/skills/*`.

If an agent can read more than one entrypoint, treat root `AGENTS.md` as the
canonical project policy and the harness-specific file as an adapter. Do not
weaken the prime directive, OpenWolf protocol, skill-routing policy, dirty
worktree safety, or verification requirements in any harness-specific adapter.

## Skill Orchestration Policy

Use Superpowers as the operating system and `agent-skills` as the toolbox.

### Instruction Priority

When instructions conflict, use this order:

1. Direct user request and this `AGENTS.md`.
2. OpenWolf project memory and project-specific constraints.
3. Superpowers workflow skills.
4. Selected `agent-skills` domain checklist.
5. Default model behavior.

Superpowers decides the process. `agent-skills` adds focused domain expertise.
Never let a broad `agent-skills` checklist override project quality priorities,
dirty-worktree safety, or Superpowers verification gates.

### Superpowers Default Workflow

For implementation, refactor, debugging, spec, QA, or git-workflow tasks:

- Start from the relevant Superpowers process skill.
- Use worktrees or branch checks when the checkout is dirty or the task is large.
- Prefer small, reversible steps.
- Verify with targeted tests, type checks, or artifact inspection appropriate to
  the touched surface.
- Before claiming completion, use verification evidence rather than confidence.

### Agent-Skills Toolbox Router

Use exactly one or a small number of `agent-skills` checklists only when the task
matches a concrete domain below. Do not load the whole pack.

When a capability exists in both Superpowers and `agent-skills`, Superpowers
wins. Do not invoke the Addy `agent-skills` twin for these shadowed areas:

| Shadowed `agent-skills` area | Use instead |
| --- | --- |
| `interview-me`, `idea-refine`, `spec-driven-development` | Superpowers `brainstorming` |
| `planning-and-task-breakdown` | Superpowers `writing-plans` |
| `test-driven-development` | Superpowers `test-driven-development` |
| `debugging-and-error-recovery` | Superpowers `systematic-debugging` plus `verification-before-completion` |
| `code-review-and-quality`, `code-simplification` | Superpowers `requesting-code-review` |
| `git-workflow-and-versioning` | Superpowers `using-git-worktrees` and `finishing-a-development-branch` |
| `incremental-implementation`, `source-driven-development`, `doubt-driven-development`, `context-engineering` | Superpowers process plus OpenWolf context |

| Task signal | Agent-skill to use |
| --- | --- |
| Web UI, dashboard, live monitoring surface | `frontend-ui-engineering` |
| Public API, module boundary, schema, contract | `api-and-interface-design` |
| Browser runtime behavior | `browser-testing-with-devtools` |
| User input, paths, secrets, auth, network fetch, subprocess of agent CLIs | `security-and-hardening` |
| Runtime speed, loop latency, bundle size | `performance-optimization` |
| Build/deploy/queue automation | `ci-cd-and-automation` |
| Removing old systems or migrating contracts | `deprecation-and-migration` |
| Architecture records or user-facing docs | `documentation-and-adrs` |
| Logging, metrics, traces, run/QA summaries | `observability-and-instrumentation` |
| Launch or production rollout | `shipping-and-launch` |

### Routing Rules

- First choose the Superpowers process skill, then select any matching
  `agent-skills` checklist as supporting guidance.
- If multiple `agent-skills` match, pick the narrowest one that covers the risk.
- If no domain-specific checklist matches, do not force one.
- If `agent-skills` is not installed or not available in the current harness,
  say so briefly and continue with Superpowers plus project rules.
- This tool runs other agents' CLIs against real target projects: treat every
  subprocess and target path as untrusted input and verify guardrails hold.
- For dirty worktrees, inspect branch/worktree state before editing and avoid
  mixing unrelated user changes into the task.

## CodeGraph

If a CodeGraph MCP server (`codegraph_*` tools) is configured, use it for
structural questions:

| Question | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Where is X defined? / Find symbol named X | `codegraph_search` |
| What calls function Y? | `codegraph_callers` |
| What does Y call? | `codegraph_callees` |
| What would break if I changed Z? | `codegraph_impact` |
| Show me Y's signature/source/docstring | `codegraph_node` |
| Give me focused context for a task/area | `codegraph_context` |
| Survey an unfamiliar module/topic | `codegraph_explore` |
| What files exist under path/ | `codegraph_files` |
| Is the index healthy? | `codegraph_status` |

Use native search only for literal text queries, comments, log messages, or when
you already know the exact file to read.

If `.codegraph/` does not exist or the MCP server says "not initialized", ask
the user whether to run `codegraph init -i`.
